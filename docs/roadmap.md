# Roadmap

MV is still in its early stages of development. After refactoring the backend code, particularly the analyzer we plan to add more features. 

We do not aim to support the full C++ language, but only the subset of features necessary to achieve the projectâ€™s goals and teach key memory related concepts

Support for other programming languages is not planned at this time but may be considered in the future 

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Backend refactoring**
- [ ] **Array support**
